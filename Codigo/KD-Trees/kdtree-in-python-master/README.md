## Contribution

If you are willing so submit a Pull Request, please keep in mind that this code should not deviate too much from the code we have written in the [K-d tree series][playlist]. It would be very strange if after watching the videos people came to this repo and saw completely different code. Because of that any refactoring contributions may be rejected without any discussion, sorry.

**Please submit only bug fixes.**
