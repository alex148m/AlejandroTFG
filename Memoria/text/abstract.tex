Association rules are mathematical objects used extensively in disciplines such as data mining, machine learning, and knowledge representation, among other fields.
Slatt is a free software project developed by José Luis Balcázar (Polytechnic University of Barcelona). It offers functionalities for the calculation of association rules. To do this, it relies on implementations of the a priori algorithm for the calculation of closures, the lattice of closures and, among others
functionalities, returns the representative rules for any choice of support and trust parameters.

In this project, this software has been improved using as a basis the implementations available in Slatt applied to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item hypergraphs and algorithms with application to these objects;
    
    \item calculation of closures and lattices (lattices);
\end{itemize}


This work has required the search and analysis of algorithms proposed in the scientific literature on the previous points.
The development language will be Python3, the previous implementation being in Python 2.7
