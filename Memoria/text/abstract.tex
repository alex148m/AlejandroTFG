Association rules are mathematical objects that are widely used in disciplines such as data mining, machine learning, and knowledge representation, among other fields.
Slatt is a free software project developed by José Luis Balcázar (Polytechnic University of Barcelona). It offers functionalities for the calculation of association rules. To do this, it relies on implementations of the a priori algorithm for the calculation of closures, lattice of closures and, among others
functionalities, returns representative rules for any choice of support and trust parameters.

In this project, this software has been improved based on the implementations available in Slatt
applied to:

- hypergraphics and algorithms with application to these objects;
- calculation of closures and lattices;

This work will require the search and analysis of the algorithms proposed in the scientific literature on the previous points.
The development language will be Python3, the previous implementation being in Python 2.7
